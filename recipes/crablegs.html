    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes!<p>
    <p>I ended up getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a little different from plain steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs, so I ended up throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe. This dish would be great with shrimp as well. Enjoy!<p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Snow Crab clusters, thawed if necessary</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit, length-wise, into the shell of each piece of crab.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in parsley, pepper, and salt. Continue to heat mixture until bubbling.
        </li>
        <li>Add crab legs to the skillet; toss to coat with butter mixture. Simmer until completely heated through, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
